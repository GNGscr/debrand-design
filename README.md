## 🧑‍💻 Author

Created by **Daniel Ehrlich**, a **Full Stack Developer** (≈70% Frontend / 30% Backend) with a strong focus on **UX, motion, and user interaction**.

## 🧠 UX Philosophy

This project was built with a **UX-first** and **design-led** development process:

- Clean visual hierarchy with scroll-aware behavior.
- Smooth intro animation that sets tone and pace.
- Focus on **motion** and **interactivity** to guide user attention.
- Mobile-specific section hiding to preserve focus.
- Tailored flow for both mouse and touch navigation.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🎞️ **Intro animation** — reveals content in a staged, cinematic way
- 🧭 **Scroll-based interactivity** — icons and sections transition with movement
- ✨ **Framer Motion animations** — microinteractions, entrance effects, hover
- 📱 **Mobile optimization** — hides certain desktop-only sections
- 🎨 **Consistent branding** — typography, spacing, and flow tightly aligned
- 🧩 **Component-based structure** — all sections modular and reusable

## 💡 UX & Interaction Highlights

- 🔁 **Scroll-based menu link color transitions**:
  Navigation menu links shift color dynamically based on scroll position.

- 🪄 **Section entrances**:
  Animated reveals bring sections into view with smooth stagger effects.

  Interactive visual responses to user actions for a lively experience.
