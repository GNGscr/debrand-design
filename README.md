## 🧑‍💻 Author

Created by **Daniel Ehrlich**, a **Full Stack Developer** (≈70% Frontend / 30% Backend) with a strong focus on **UX, motion, and user interaction**.  
Responsible for **ideation, UX planning, interface design, animations, dev & deployment** — fully end-to-end.

---

## 🧠 UX Philosophy

This project was built with a **UX-first** and **design-led** development process:

- Clean visual hierarchy with scroll-aware behavior.
- Smooth intro animation that sets tone and pace (using gsap).
- Focus on **motion** and **interactivity** to guide user attention.
- Mobile-specific section hiding to preserve focus.
- Tailored flow for both mouse and touch navigation.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🎞️ **Intro animation** — reveals content in a staged, cinematic way (created with gsap)
- 🧭 **Scroll-based interactivity** — icons and sections transition with movement
- ✨ **Framer Motion animations** — microinteractions, entrance effects, hover
- 📱 **Mobile optimization** — hides certain desktop-only sections
- 🎨 **Consistent branding** — typography, spacing, and flow tightly aligned
- 🧩 **Component-based structure** — all sections modular and reusable

---

## 💡 UX & Interaction Highlights

- 🔁 **Scroll-based menu link color transitions**:
  Navigation menu links shift color dynamically based on scroll position.

- 🪄 **Section entrances**:
  Animated reveals bring sections into view with smooth stagger effects.

- 🖱️ **Hover & motion interactions**:
  Interactive visual responses to user actions for a lively experience.

## 🐬 Custom Animation Highlight – Rive Integration

A custom entrance animation of a **waving dolphin** is featured in the Projects section.

- 🎨 **Design**: The dolphin was designed manually in **Figma**, based on inspirational references and adapted to match the app's style and tone.
- 🔧 **Animation**: Animated using **Rive**, an advanced real-time animation engine.
- ⚙️ **Integration**: Controlled via JavaScript and React to match scroll behavior and timing.
- 💡 Originally created for a youth/education-based learning app (volunteer project that was never launched), it was repurposed here to showcase animation capabilities.

This demonstrates:
- Custom asset creation
- Integration of external animation tools in production
- Crafting playful, interactive experiences with attention to performance and UX

## 🔍 Summary

Debrand Design showcases a unique fusion of **visual storytelling, animation precision, and minimalist UX structure**.  
It's meant to function as both a portfolio and a product that reflects the developer's values: clarity, creativity, and interactivity.
